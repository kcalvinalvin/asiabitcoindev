**East Asia Bitcoin Apprenticeship** was originally started in Jan of 2025 along with [Fulgur Ventures](https://fulgur.ventures) and [Diamond Hands](https://www.diamondhands.community). The program is now spearheaded by [Calvin Kim](https://x.com/kcalvinalvinn), focusing on Korean Bitcoin developers. As of today, the program has [1 developer](https://github.com/Specter2100) in training.

Biggest thanks to [Teruko Neriki](https://x.com/terukoneriki) for brining the program to life and for running
the pilot program in Japan.

The current program was made possible by the support from the [**Human Rights Foundation**](https://hrf.org/devfund).
